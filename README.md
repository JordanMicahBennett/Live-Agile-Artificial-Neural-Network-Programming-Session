# Live-Agile-Artificial-Neural-Network-Programming-Session
Agile neural network programming sessions, for reasonably rapid data science preparation.


# Session 1 
* Held at National Commercial Bank, with small QA team, December 18, 2020.

Since artificial neural networks can represent a wide variety of utilities as seen in [Universal Approximation Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem), and since neural networks power most cognitive/smart apps today, the agile ML process concerns 2 topics:

# Introduction
In an agile setting where months may not be available for data science courses, this is a reasonably optimal way of quickly getting a developer of starting or intermediate coding skills to understand overall layout of machine learning.

1.	Most basic Neural network programming in detail (in BlueJ or any IDE of choice. BlueJ is good for quickly visualizing how classes connect, as coding takes place.)
2.	Data preprocessing.
