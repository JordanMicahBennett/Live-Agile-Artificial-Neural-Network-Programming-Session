# Live-Agile-Artificial-Neural-Network-Programming-Sessions
Agile neural network programming sessions by God Bennett, for reasonably rapid data science preparation.

# Fun note: 1000+ lines of basic neural network code were written in Java from memory/scratch by God Bennett for the session below. God can also write the same 1000+ lines of neural network code at any given time from memory/scratch, [after years of bi-annual practice](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/NEURAL_NETWORK_PRACTICE). Note that memorizing this neural network code as God does, is reasonably not required, although writing one out step by step is beneficial, as discussed below.

1. [Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence), also known as human level AI, is known as [humanity's last big invention](https://youtu.be/9snY7lhJA4c), according to AI/AGI experts including winner of [2018 Turing award](https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/bengio_3406375.cfm) (similar to nobel prize but for computer science)  [Professor Yoshua Bengio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU9cQ1JdC7Y), as well as [Dr Ben Goertzel](https://youtu.be/9snY7lhJA4c), and other AGI experts including [Eray Ozkural, winner of 2015 Kurzweil AGI award](http://agi-conf.org/2015/prizes/).
   * Notably, [AGI/human level AI is slated to emerge by 2029](https://www.businessinsider.com/ray-kurzweil-thinks-well-have-human-level-ai-by-2029-2014-12), based on [Google/Kurzweil's law of accelerated change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change).

This session aims to equip the programmer with fundamental artificial neural network programming skills. Neural networks (embedded inthe goal of AGI research) are [universal function approximators aka universal tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem) that can approximate a wide variety of tasks, somewhat similar to how 1 human brain or natural neural network can do driving, teaching, nursing etc, reading, writing etc.

# Introduction
In an agile setting where months may not be available for data science courses, this is a reasonably optimal way of quickly getting a developer of starting or intermediate coding skills to understand overall layout of machine learning.

Since artificial neural networks can represent a wide variety of utilities/functions as seen in [Universal Approximation Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem), and since neural networks power most cognitive/smart apps today, God's agile artificial intelligence/machine learning process concerns 2 topics:

1.	Most basic Neural network programming in detail (in BlueJ or any IDE of choice. BlueJ is good for quickly visualizing how classes connect, as coding takes place.)
2.	Data preprocessing.
