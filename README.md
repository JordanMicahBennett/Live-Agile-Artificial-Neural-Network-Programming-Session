# Live-Agile-Artificial-Neural-Network-Programming-Sessions
Agile neural network programming sessions by God Bennett, for reasonably rapid data science preparation.

# Fun note: 1000+ lines of basic neural network code was written in Java from memory/scratch by God Bennett for the session below. God can also write the same 1000+ lines of neural network code at any given time from memory/scratch, [after years of bi-annual practice](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/NEURAL_NETWORK_PRACTICE). Note that memorizing this neural network code as God does, is reasonably not required, although writing one out step by step is beneficial, as discussed below.

# Introduction
In an agile setting where months may not be available for data science courses, this is a reasonably optimal way of quickly getting a developer of starting or intermediate coding skills to understand overall layout of machine learning.

Since artificial neural networks can represent a wide variety of utilities/functions as seen in [Universal Approximation Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem), and since neural networks power most cognitive/smart apps today, the agile artificial intelligence/machine learning process concerns 2 topics:

1.	Most basic Neural network programming in detail (in BlueJ or any IDE of choice. BlueJ is good for quickly visualizing how classes connect, as coding takes place.)
2.	Data preprocessing.
