# Live-Agile-Artificial-Neural-Network-Programming-Session
Agile neural network programming sessions, for reasonably rapid data science preparation.

# Introduction
In an agile setting where months may not be available for data science courses, this is a reasonably optimal way of quickly getting a developer of starting or intermediate coding skills to understand overall layout of machine learning.

# Session 1 
* Held at National Commercial Bank, with small QA team, December 18, 2020.
